![architecture](architecture.png)

## Project Overview :globe_with_meridians:	
In this project we will create 2 microservices with a aggregator service which combines data from the two microservice and displays it in a meaningful manner. We will be using `spring boot` as our backend and `reactJS` as our frontend. Note: Both microservices would havee 2 different types of databases, MongoDb and MySQL.

**About** : in the first microservice is basically a task management tool where taks can be created, read, updateed and deleted. The tasks can have a title, description as well as a status toggle to either publish the task or not publish. The second microservice is in progress .............
